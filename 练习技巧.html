        <h1>练习技巧</br>Practices</h1>
        <p>针对之前提到的四种常见泳姿，这里分门别类地给大家总结了不同的有针对性的练习技巧，一起来看看吧~
       
       蛙泳：
       身体姿势：两臂并拢前伸，两腿伸直，身体较水平地俯卧于水面，有一个短暂的滑行瞬间。当划手和抬头稀奇时，下颌露出水面，肩部升起，开始收腿动作。
       Glide technique for breaststroke：The glide is the beginning and ending position of the stroke cycle and is the foundation of breaststroke swimming: your body is in a straight line with your legs and arms extended, your face is in the water, and your body is prone.
       臂部动作：外划——内划——前伸
       The breaststroke arm pull has four parts: Glide, outsweep, insweep, recovery.
       1、外划。双手前伸，手掌倾斜大约45°（小拇指朝上）。双手同时向外、向后方划动，继而屈臂向后、向下方划。
       2、内划。掌心由外转向内，手带动小臂加速内划，手由下向上并在胸前并拢（手高肘低、肘在肩下），前伸。
       3、前伸。双手向前伸（肘关节伸直）。
       Glide: Start with your arms fully extended in front of your body with your palms pointing down and fingertips pointing forward (the sides of your thumbs should be touching). hands together in front of your chest in a praying position with your fingertips pointing forward away from your body. Then drive your arms forward and fully extending your arms straight in front of your body.
       Outsweep: Turn your palms slightly outward (so your thumbs point slightly downward) and, keeping your arms straight, sweep your arms out to your sides until they form a “Y” shape with your body.
       Insweep: Bend your elbows and move your forearms down and back as you pull your hands together in front of your chest in a praying position. This is the all-important phase of the breaststroke pull, as it serves as the power that pulls your body forward. This is also the phase where you lift your head out of the water to take a breath.
       Recovery: Extend your arms forward just below the surface to enter the glide phase, and begin the cycle again.

       腿部动作：收腿——翻脚——蹬水——滑行
       1、收腿：屈膝收腿，脚跟向臀部靠拢，小腿躲在大腿后面慢收腿。
       2、翻脚：两脚距离大于两膝距离，两脚外翻，脚尖朝外，脚掌朝天，小腿和脚内侧对准水，像英文字母“W”。
       3、蹬水：实际上是腿伸直的过程（屈髋、伸膝），由腰腹和大腿同时发力，以小腿和脚内侧同时蹬夹水，先是向外、向后、向下，然后是向内、向上方蹬水，就像画半个圆圈。
       4、滑行：双腿并拢伸直后在一个短暂的滑行（1-2秒）。
       呼吸：臂部内划时呼吸 节奏：双臂伸展时完成蹬腿
       Kicking technique for breaststroke:
       Unlike freestyle and backstroke, the breaststroke doesn’t use a flutter kick. Instead, it mimics a frog kick:
       Start with your legs straight and together.
       Bend your knees so they point out to the sides while keeping your feet together. Your feet should come in toward your torso.
       Keeping your knees where they are, separate your feet to extend your legs straight out to a diagonal, in a “V” shape, and then quickly squeeze your legs together to come back to the starting position. This step should be fast and fluid.

       蝶泳：
       身体姿势：头和躯干有时露出水面、有时潜入水中，形成波浪式上下起伏的变化位置。
       Butterfly in the water:
       Your body should be led by the crown of your head with your shoulders and hips horizontal.
       Try to keep your body as close as possible to the surface of the water.
       臂部动作：入水一抱水一划水一推水一出水—空中移臂
       1、入水：入水时肘稍屈井略高于小臂，手掌领先，然后带动小臂和大臂依次入水。
       2、抱水：手的运动方向为向外一向后一向下。
       3、划水。划水时，前臂和手掌是划水的主要对水面。屈肘，使肘部保持较高的位置。前臂外旋动作和逐步加大屈臂的动作是同时进行的。
       4、推水。当两手距离最近时，双手做弧形向外推水的动作。手的运动方向为向外——向上——向后的方向。
       5、出水：肘关节微屈，手掌向上，肘先于手出水，两臂放松内旋，沿身体两侧低平的拋物线前摆。
       6、空中移臂：开始移臂时稍用力，利用臂的离心力向前摆出。移臂时速度要快，否则会造成身体下沉。
       Butterfly arm action:
       The arm action can be split into three propulsive, simultaneous sweeps.
       The arms should stretch out in front of the body above the water surface and be led into the water by the thumb. The hands should enter about shoulder width apart with elbows bent and slightly higher than the hands.
       Your hands then sweep down and out to form a Y shape in front of the body. Turn and sweep your hands back in towards each other, keeping your elbows high.
       Finally, turn your hands up and back and sweep parallel to the side of your body.
       Recovery of the arms is aggressive as you stretch them back out in front of you to re-enter. Keep your arms out of the water but try to avoid lowering your hips – the aim is to keep as streamlined as close to the water as possible.

       腿部动作：双腿自然并拢，脚跟外张，双脚司时上下打水
       1、蝶泳打水时,两腿自然并拢，脚跟稍微分开成“内八字”
       2、两腿伸直向上移动，髋关节逐渐展开，臂部下沉。
       3、当两腿继续向上时，大腿开始下压，膝关节随大腿下压，动作自然弯曲，大腿继续加速向下。
       4、随着屈膝程度的增加，脚抬至接近水面时，臂部下降到最低点，脚向上抬至最高点，并准确向下后方打水。
       Butterfly kicking:
       The leg action comes from the hips. The heels and soles of your feet should break the surface from underneath with your knees slightly bent on the upbeat.
       Powerful downbeats of the feet then propel the body forward. Try to keep your legs close together with your ankles relaxed.
       Your downbeat kick should occur as the arms enter and sweep out.
       Try to kick twice per arm cycle – once to propel your arms out of the water for recovery and once as the arms enter the water.
       呼吸：推水伸颌，抬头吸气，移臂
       节奏：划臂1次，打腿2次，低头呼气
       Butterfly breathing
       The most common butterfly breathing is to the front.
       Like in breaststroke, your shoulders should lead your head out of the water. Your front should rise naturally with the undulation of your body.
       Keep your chin in front of your forehead and inhale quickly in through your mouth.
       After inhalation, quickly lower your head before exhaling quickly under the water through your mouth and nose. Your head should re-enter the water before your arms.
       Exhalation usually occurs during the final upsweep and inhalation as the arms start to recover.
       The most common breathing cycle is once every two arm cycles but some competitive swimmers choose to swim every cycle for longer races or every three cycles for shorter races.
       Another common technique is breathing twice every three cycles – just use whichever you find most comfortable.

       仰泳：
       身体姿势：仰卧，腰腹适当紧张，展髋，使身体自然伸直并保持高平浮的姿势。
       Keep your body flat like a plank. When you're doing the backstroke, you want your body to lay as flat on the surface of the water as possible. The smaller your profile in the water, the less resistance you'll feel as you swim and the easier it will be to go fast.
       臂部动作：入水一抱水一划水一出水一移臂
       1、入水：直臂、掌心向外、小指先入水，入水点在肩前延长线与身体中线之间。
       2、抱水：入水后伸肩，手向前、下、侧方滑去，略勾手腕，把水“抱住”。
       3、划水：划水又分“拉水”和“推水”两步。
       拉水。拉水是手臂动作从划水开始至肩横线。
       推水。推水是从肩横线至划水结束。
       4、出水：借助身体向对侧方转动和手掌向下压水的反作用力，提肩、由肩带动臂出水。
       5、移臂：出水后，迅速沿着肩的垂直面直臂向前移动。
       Use a long, fluid arm motion. As you start to kick forward, keep your arms at your sides. Reach one arm up in front of you. It should point toward the sky or ceiling. Bring it up over your head, by your ear, and down into the water — it will be pointing in the direction you're traveling.
       Position your hands to minimize resistance. To swim as efficiently as possible, it is important to remember that your hands should enter and exit the water with their edges first, not their palms. When you lift your arm out of the water, lead with your thumb. When it enters the water, lead with your pinky finger.
       Rotate your shoulders and hips with each stroke. Your motions in the pool shouldn't be rigid like a steamboat. Instead, keep them fluid and flexible to get through the water as efficiently as possible. See below:
       As you raise each arm, rotate your shoulder upwards. Rotate the opposite shoulder downwards — you should be using it to pull the other hand under the water.
       Similarly, twist your hips slightly with each kick. You should have an ever-so-slight "wiggling" motion — your right hip should go down when your right leg kicks and vice versa.

       腿部动作：双腿靠拢上下交替打腿
       两腿自然伸直上下交替打水，两腿打水幅度 40cm 左右。向上打水的效果大于向下打水。
       Use a "flutter" kick. As soon as you're in position on your back, start kicking. Your legs should be straightened, close together, and lined up below your hips. Use short kicking motions to propel yourself forward. As you raise one leg, kick the other down (and vice versa).
       呼吸：一只胳膊移动时呼气，另一只移动时吸气
       节奏：划臂2次，打腿6次
       Breathe once per arm cycle. A good policy is to breathe in as one arm leaves the water, then breathe out as the other leaves the water. Repeat this pattern with deep breaths to keep your breath steady.

       自由泳：
       身体姿势：自由泳时身体保持水平姿势，髋略低于肩。两眼注视前下方，游进中躯干围绕身体纵轴自然转动 35°-45°。
       Body Position：
       Streamline is the fundamental body position in swimming. In streamline, you make your body as narrow as possible to help reduce drag as you dive in or push off the wall. When in streamline, squeeze your biceps to your ears and keep your legs tight together. Any extra space creates resistance that can slow you down! Think like a torpedo.
       臂部动作：入水一伸展一抱水一划水一移臂
       1、入水：手的入水点在肩的延长线和身体中线之间，以大拇指领先，斜插入水。
       2、伸展：入水后，手、肘、肩继续前伸，使手臂伸展。
       3、抱水：随着身体的转动，屈航、屈时，手臂向外、后方抓水。
       4、划水： 手下划到最低点后，旋转手臂向内、上、后方划水，保持高肘屈臂的划水姿势。
       5、移臂：出水后，手臂自然、放松地经空中向前移臂，保持高肘姿势。然后手在肩前领先入水，开始下一个动作。
       The pull:
       Now for the pull. Your hand should enter the water fingertips first, slightly wider than your shoulders. Think 11 and 1 on a clock! 
       Related: What is Early Vertical Forearm?
       Reach and extend your arm forward, and initiate an Early Vertical Forearm (EVF). Bend at the elbow, and pull straight back toward your feet, keeping your elbow nice and high. EVF turns your forearm into a huge paddle, allowing you to pull more water than you would with a straight arm. It’s also easier on your shoulders, too.
       When your hand exits the water, keep your elbow high as you recover and re-enter the water. A good rule of thumb is to keep your elbow above your hand both above and below the water!

       腿部动作：鞭状打水
       1、打腿动作从髋部开始发力，大腿带动小腿，做鞭状打水动作。
       2、向上打水腿从直到弯。以直腿开始向上打，脚接近水面时屈膝，小腿上抬，使脚等露出水面后向下打水。向下打水前膝关节弯曲角度约 130-160°，打水幅度约为30-40cm。打水时要绷脚，不要勾脚。
       The kick:
       In freestyle kick, your legs should be relatively straight, with minimal knee bend. The kick should come from your hips, rather than your knees. Keep your toes pointed.
       Your kick should be small and fast — try not to let the space between your feet exceed half a meter (about 18 inches). You may think taking large kicks will be more powerful, but when it comes to speed and efficiency, a compact kick is the way to go.
       呼吸：两臂各划一次做一次呼吸
       节奏：打腿6次，两臂各划水1次
       Breathing
       Once you’ve got your head position down, it’s time to add in breathing. We know breathing can be really challenging when you’re new to swimming, and it can be tempting to lift your head straight up to catch your breath if you’re really tired. Remember: Lifting your head up will create more drag, making it even harder to keep moving forward.
       Instead, turn your head to the side, keeping one eye and one ear in the water. It may feel like you’re going to inhale water, but your forward momentum will create a small air pocket that’s just big enough for you to take a quick breath!
